        registration number 11438202, with our registered office at 20 rue
        d'Isly 35000 Rennes. We refer to ourselves as “Blue Limes” in these
        Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is Blue Limes' policy to respect your privacy regarding any

        <a href="https://bluelimes.dev/">https://bluelimes.dev/</a>
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://bluelimes.dev"). We respect your privacy
        and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
        provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
        Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how
        we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the

        from other sources.
      </p>

        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Blue Limes collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Blue Limes' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Blue Limes' visitors use its
        website. From time to time, Blue Limes may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blue Limes also collects potentially personally-identifying information
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
        leaving comments on https://bluelimes.dev blog posts. Blue Limes only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Blue Limes' websites choose to interact with Blue
        Limes in ways that require Blue Limes to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that Blue Limes gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but

        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
