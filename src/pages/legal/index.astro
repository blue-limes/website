      <h3>Blue Limes' obligations</h3>
      <p>Blue Limes undertakes that:</p>

          care.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The undertaking at clause 12.1 shall not apply to the extent of any
        non-conformance which is caused by use of the Blue Limes Product
        contrary to Blue Limes' instructions, or modification or alteration of
        the Blue Limes Product by any party other than Blue Limes or Blue Limes'
        duly authorised contractors or agents, or the Customer’s failure to
        promptly install any update, upgrade, new version or new release of the
        Software released by Blue Limes, or any other non-conformance caused by
        the Customer’s acts or omissions. If the Blue Limes Product does not
        conform with the foregoing undertaking, Blue Limes will, at its expense,
        use all reasonable commercial endeavours to correct any such
        non-conformance promptly, or provide the Customer with an alternative
        means of accomplishing the desired performance. Such correction or
        substitution constitutes the Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for
        any breach of the undertaking set out in clause 12.1. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, Blue Limes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          does not warrant that the Customer's use of the Blue Limes Product
          will be uninterrupted or error-free; or that the Blue Limes Product
          and/or the information obtained by the Customer through the Blue Limes

          limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of such
          communications facilities.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This Contract shall not prevent Blue Limes from entering into similar
        agreements with third parties, or from independently developing, using,
        selling or licensing documentation, products and/or services which are
        similar to those provided under this Contract.

        <li>
          ensure that the Customer System complies with the relevant
          specifications provided by Blue Limes from time to time; and
        </li>
        <li>
          be solely responsible for procuring, maintaining and securing its
          network connections and telecommunications links from the Customer
          System to Blue Limes' data centres, and for all problems, conditions,
          delays, delivery failures and all other loss or damage arising from or
          relating to the Customer System or telecommunications links or caused
          by the internet.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Whilst Blue Limes may provide the Customer with advice, recommendations
        and other services related to the Experiments, the Customer agrees that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          it is the Customer’s sole responsibility to select, create and run the
          most appropriate Experiments based on the Customer’s detailed
          understanding of the Customer’s business and the Customer System; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Blue Limes shall not be responsible for, and shall have no liability
          to the Customer for, the selection, creation or running of the
          Experiments by the Customer.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Customer warrants and represents on an ongoing basis that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          all software code, materials and other items created by the Customer
          in connection with the Customer’s use of the Blue Limes Product are
          the Customer’s original work, have not been copied (wholly or
          substantially) from any other source, and that the Customer’s (or any
          other person’s) use of them will not infringe the Intellectual
          Property Rights of any third party; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the use of any software code, materials or other items used, provided
          or made available by the Customer in connection with the Blue Limes
          Product or the Blue Limes Services will not infringe the Intellectual
          Property Rights of any third party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer shall indemnify Blue Limes for all claims, costs, damage
        and expenses (including reasonable legal expenses) incurred by Blue
        Limes as a result of the Customer’s breach of clause 13.3.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of experiments in live environment</h3>
      <p>The Customer acknowledges that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Experiments can cause serious damage to the Customer System and
          the Customer’s business (including IT system and software failures and
          outages) so they must be used in a Sandbox Environment and must not be
          used in a Live Environment; and
        </li>
        <li>
          if the Customer uses the Experiments in a Live Environment in breach
          of clause 14.1.1, the Customer does so entirely at its own risk and
          Blue Limes shall have no liability to the Customer as a result of the
          Customer’s use of the Experiment in a Live Environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Charges and payment</h3>

        <li>
          disable the Customer's password, account and access to all or part of
          the Blue Limes Product and Blue Limes shall be under no obligation to
          provide any or all of the Blue Limes Product while the invoice(s)
          concerned remain unpaid;
        </li>
        <li>
          require the Customer and the Authorised Users to stop accessing and

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>All amounts due under this Contract:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>shall be payable in pounds sterling;</li>
        <li>are non-cancellable and non-refundable; and</li>
        <li>
          are exclusive of value added tax, which shall be added to Blue Limes'
          invoice(s) at the appropriate rate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Blue Limes shall be entitled to increase the Charges at the start of

      <p>
        Each Party shall ensure that the other's Confidential Information to

      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection
        Legislation:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the parties are independent controllers of all Personal Data received
          by Blue Limes in connection with the setting up, administration and
          management of the Authorised User’s accounts for the Blue Limes
          Product; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the Customer is the controller and Blue Limes is the processor of all
          Personal Data processed through the Blue Limes Product in connection
          with the Experiments. The Annex to this Schedule sets out the scope,
          nature and purpose of processing by Blue Limes, the duration of the
          processing and the types of personal data and categories of data
          subject.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents
        and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the personal data to
        Blue Limes for the duration and purposes of this Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blue Limes shall, in relation to any personal data processed on behalf
        of the Customer:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          process that personal data only on the documented written instructions
          of the Customer unless Blue Limes is required by applicable laws to
          otherwise process that personal data. Where Blue Limes is relying on
          the laws of a member of the European Union or European Union Law as
          the basis for processing personal data, Blue Limes shall promptly
          notify the Customer of this before performing the processing required
          by the applicable laws unless those applicable laws prohibit Blue
          Limes from so notifying the Customer;
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational
          measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of
          personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage
          to, personal data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the
          unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or
          damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to
          the state of technological development and the cost of implementing
          any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate,
          pseudonymising and encrypting personal data, ensuring confidentiality,
          integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services,
          ensuring that availability of and access to personal data can be
          restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing
          and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational
          measures adopted by it);
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process personal
          data are obliged to keep the personal data confidential; and
        </li>
        <li>
          not transfer any personal data outside of the United Kingdom or the
          European Economic Area unless the following conditions are fulfilled:
          <ol>
            <li>
              appropriate safeguards are provided in relation to the transfer;
            </li>
            <li>
              the data subject has enforceable rights and effective legal
              remedies;
            </li>
            <li>
              Blue Limes complies with its obligations under the Data Protection
              Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any
              personal data that is transferred; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Blue Limes complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in
              advance by the Customer with respect to the processing of the
              personal data.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          assist the Customer, at the Customer's cost, in responding to any
          request from a data subject and in ensuring compliance with its
          obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to
          security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations
          with supervisory authorities or regulators;
        </li>
        <li>
          notify the Customer without undue delay on becoming aware of a
          personal data breach;
        </li>
        <li>
          at the written direction of the Customer, delete or return personal
          data and copies thereof to the Customer on termination of the Contract
          unless required by applicable law to store the personal data; and
        </li>
        <li>
          allow for audits by the Customer or the Customer's designated auditor
          and immediately inform the Customer if, in the opinion of Blue Limes,
          an instruction infringes the Data Protection Legislation.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer consents to Blue Limes appointing third-party processors.
        Blue Limes shall inform the Customer of any changes to the third-party
        processors so the Customer has a reasonable opportunity to object to the
        change. Blue Limes shall enter into a written agreement with the
        third-party processor incorporating terms which are substantially
        similar to those set out in this Schedule. As between the Customer and
        Blue Limes, Blue Limes shall remain fully liable for all acts or
        omissions of any third-party processor appointed by it pursuant to this
        paragraph.
